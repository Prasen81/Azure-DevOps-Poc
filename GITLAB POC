AUTO DEVOPS :
    - easy to start with , have GCP account and to test create template based project say RUBY on Rails. once its craeted an auto DevOps enabled , a pipeline
    will be craeted with Build , test and Dast stage (Dynamic testing).
    - if you have GCP account let GITlan create and manage your kubernetes cluster , its done in minutes and also check the deployment to Production option
    - with K8s enabled it allows to have Promtheus as monitoring tool and Ingress for load balancing
    - for Gitlab managed service and with free account things work quite slow so though the guide doesnt mention of installing teh Gitlan runner and using the shared service 
    its better to use that or look into that option
    - at the production stage log yopu can see the web address of the application
    - tried the deployment to stage and manual deployment to Prod too... The REVIEW stage log gives you an oppertunity review the application before it goes to 
    Production http://dast-15662678-dast-default.35.239.198.89.nip.io then it goes to Staging (http://prasen81-ruby-test-staging.35.239.198.89.nip.io)
    once its deployed in Staging Dast enviornment gets delted automatically 
    - waiting for manual action and also how much production deployment you wish to go that means how many nodes in K8S cluster 
    there are different strategies available , so lets say we go with 50% and then 100% check the behaviour opf the pipeline
    - Runner , for auto devops default comes with gitlab provided shared runners and with K8s its possible to install ur project specific Runner
    and then disable the shared runner ( there are other variants of Runners like Group,shared and specific)
    its lighting speed ...wowww!!
    How this manual deployment to production can work , what it means having 50% or 25% ?? strategy wise....
    - Autodevops environment variables : can help us to control sub stages ...of the pipeline for Autodevops
    refer
    Auto Devops CI/CD.yml
    https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml
    
    Created an Issue , assigned to myself and then created a merge request which in general is like a Pull request which default creates 
    a branch and then start working for the issue in the new branch fix the issue and commit the change it will trigger the Auto DevOps
    Pipeline. if the build failed then the merge request is assigned back to assigned person .
    
    Once the test successful there will be View app in the merge request , please check the stages you will not see anything to Deploy , though we can anable staging to deploy , i guess 
    that we can test. if the review is fine then we can merge it master which will create another pipeline and will delete the branch once its
    done sucecssfully.
    
    okay tried another example template note AutoDevOps not working for .net core project , so will check it part of CI/CD part task
